basic attack (player/boss):
(2*Math.round(Math.pow(a,1.1) * (100/(100+d))) * r); 
where a is atk of attacker, d is defence of target, r is random number for 0.95 to 1.05.

skills (player/boss):
(2*p/100*Math.round(Math.pow(a,1.1) * (100/(100+d))) * r); 
where a is atk of attacker, d is defence of target, r is random number for 0.95 to 1.05, p is potency of skill.
